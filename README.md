AlgorithmicHeights
==================
Project for studying basic algorithms for effective storing and searching data
----------------------
### Roadmap:
	* Lists
	* Heaps
	* Sortings
	* Hash-tables
	* Suffix-trees
	* B-trees
	* Deep searh
	* Depth search
	* Short paths
	* Maximal flows
	* Minimum spanning trees
